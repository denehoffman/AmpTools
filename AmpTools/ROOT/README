There are some AmpTools classes that can be useful to use in the context of a ROOT session.

FitResults and NormIntInterface:

These provide an interface to the results of a fit and can be helpful when trying to extract
particular numerical results, e.g., coherent sums of amplitudes and uncertainties.

ConfigurationInfo:

This can be useful when one wants to write complex looping structures to generate a
config file that can then be used for a fit.

In order to use these classes modify your .rootrc file in your home directory and
edit the MacroPath variable to include the path to this directory and the top level
AmpTools source directory.

Unix.*.Root.MacroPath:   .:$(AMPTOOLS):$(AMPTOOLS)/ROOT:

Inside of ROOT then execute:

.x loadAmpTools.C

This will make the classes above available for use on the ROOT command line.
