/**
 * This class represents a user defined amplitude.  In its most abstract
 * sense it is a mechanism to turn a set of four vectors describing an
 * event into a complex number that represents the amplitude for 
 * some physics process.  These amplitudes can be added to the AmplitudeManager
 * as factors that build-up a decay amplitude for a particular final state.
 * 
 * It is recommended that the user factorize the physics amplitudes as much as
 * possible.  For example, a user may have an Amplitude class that defines
 * how to compute a Breit-Wigner and another Amplitude class that describes
 * some two-body angular distribution.  The complete decay amplitude for a
 * two-body resonance is given by a product of these two.  The factorization
 * ultimately improves optimization potential since only factors with
 * free parameters need to be recomputed at each fit iteration.
 *
 * In addition users should typically not permute identical particles in 
 * the construction of the amplitude.  Doing so "breaks" the factorization 
 * feature built into the AmplitudeManager since ( a1 + a2 ) * ( b1 + b2 ) is 
 * not equal to ( a1 b1 + a2 b2 ) for permutations 1 and 2 and amplitudes a and b.
 * Instead the AmplitudeManager provides a mechanism to permute idnetical
 * particles or charge conjugates for a particular amplitude.
 *
 * Finally the Amplitude class is intended to define methods only for
 * calculating amplitudes and should not be used as a data storage class.
 * The same instance of the Amplitude class will be used for calculations
 * over different sets of data.
